# Estimating the death toll in Gaza

Since the start of the war on Gaza, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Government of Media Office (GMO) have been producing statistical reports of casualties. These are the numbers widely reported, and often dismissed, by media and politicians. Today, on 15th Oct 2024, the official number of casualties stands at 43.063.

Increasingly, a number of experts agree that this number does not reflect reality: it severely underestimates the death toll of the war waged by Israel.

More than a year into the ongoing genocide, it is important to give a more accurate picture of the horror that unfolds in Gaza.

In this article, we will review the MoH methodology, the exacerbating limitations that it's facing as war goes on, and the estimates from independent researchers and humanitarians.

Below is the chart that we have produced. This is a conservative estimate of the true death toll of the Gaza genocide. 

Today, we are nearing 200.000 dead.
