# Report: In one year, more than 100,000 deaths in Gaza—aided by over $17.9 billion from the US

On October 7, 2024, the Costs of War Project at Brown University released two new reports. [One report](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf) from the military-research group details how much the United States government has spent aiding the Israeli military between October 2023 and September 2024. The other gathers and evaluates previously published data to [estimate the human cost](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/IndirectDeathsGaza) of this past year’s unrelenting violence.

In both cases, the researchers show staggering new findings.

The Costs of War Project researchers estimate the cost to US taxpayers at over $17.9 billion, and the likely number of people killed at well over 100,000—which, even then, is a “very conservative, minimum amount of death.” As researchers begin to calculate the costs, the human and monetary toll is starting to become clearer.

### Human Cost

To estimate the human cost of Israel’s war on Gaza, researcher Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins started with the Gaza Ministry of Health’s [count of confirmed deaths](https://www.ochaopt.org/), which has now surpassed 41,615.

Beyond that, [an estimated 10,000 people](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149256) are buried under rubble. Over the past year, [60 percent of buildings](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/oct-7-tens-thousands-dead-forever-war-rcna166765) and [nearly all road-systems](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/after-a-year-of-israeli-bombardment-gaza-is-in-ruins-it-may-take-years-to-rebuild) in Gaza have been destroyed, making the retrieval of dead and injured people near-impossible. Adding an estimate of those who have died by starvation—about 62,413 people—brings the total estimated death toll to 114,000, or about 5 percent of Gaza’s population. Those likely death-by-starvation numbers come from a letter [99 physicians who served in Gaza](http://gazahealthcareletters.org) sent President Joe Biden last week.

“With only marginal exceptions, every single person in Gaza is sick, injured, or both,” the physicians wrote to Biden. “We worry that unknown thousands have already died from the lethal combination of malnutrition and disease, and that tens of thousands more will die in the coming months, especially with the onset of the winter rains in Gaza. Most of them will be young children.”

Still, as Costs of War Project director Stephanie Savell told *Mother Jones*, factors like the [destruction of water infrastructure](https://www.csis.org/analysis/siege-gazas-water) and sanitary facilities mean the real loss may be incalculable for years to come. Savell said that the numbers used here are a “really solid, conservative minimum number of deaths.”

Given the [depletion of Gaza’s medical system](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/gaza-european-hospital-doctor-palestine-israel-war/), thousands more have likely died due to lack of care for their chronic illnesses. (Cancer care, for example, has been unavailable in Gaza, as has most [prenatal care](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/10/reports-pregnant-gazans-miscarrying/). Women are dying in [childbirth](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/gaza-pregnancy-reveal-episode/) without adequate care, and are reportedly undergoing [cesareans without anesthesia](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/08/dnc-palestine-gaza-doctors-uncommitted-israel-kamala-harris/): “A big portion of death tolls from war comes in deaths of newborns, and pregnant mothers,” Savell said.

Since the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel one year ago on October 7 that killed nearly 1,200, Israel has [imposed](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/israel-blocked-huminitarian-aid-gaza-palestine-biden-anthony-blinken/) a severe blockade on food entering Gaza. “96 percent of Gaza’s population faces acute levels of food insecurity, with 2.15 million people in crisis levels of hunger or worse,” the Costs of War Project researchers reported, noting that Israel’s government has limited humanitarian aid convoys entering Gaza that might alleviate that hunger or bring in medical supplies. (A recent *ProPublica *report found that officials with the US State Department were aware that Israel deliberately [blocked](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/09/israel-blocked-huminitarian-aid-gaza-palestine-biden-anthony-blinken/) aid to Gaza, which would have triggered a potential end to arms shipments to the close ally; Secretary of State Antony Blinken reportedly rejected the findings.)

Researchers at Brown cited the metric for estimating indirect deaths used by the authors of [a letter](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/palestine-gaza-israel-death-toll-gaza-health-ministry/) published in the medical journal *The Lancet* in July, that warned deaths might be much higher in Gaza than currently reported: four “indirect deaths”—that is, preventable deaths from starvation, or untreated illness, for example—for every direct death in a war. In this case, though, “It seems to me that ratio might be much higher,” Savell said.

Israel’s campaign in Gaza has been directly financed by the United States, which [supplies 69 percent of Israel’s weapons imports](https://thedefensepost.com/2024/03/26/us-germany-israel-weapons/).

### Monetary Cost

Costs of War Project researchers Linda J. Bilmes, William D. Hartung, and Stephen Semler calculated that the United States government has spent $17.9 billion providing military supplies—including weapons, ammunition, vehicles, bombs, and jet fuel—to the Israeli army over the past year.

Those weapons have come through a variety of channels, including commercial sales approved by the State Department, Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Financing (which provides grants for countries to buy from US defense contractors), and a program providing excess military equipment no longer needed by the US military to ally nations for a steep discount.

“There are different degrees of public information available on each of these arms channels, and there have also been efforts to hide the full amounts of aid and types of systems through bureaucratic maneuvering,” the researchers explained.

In addition to the $17.9 billion going directly to Israel, the US Navy is spending at least $4.86 billion in the region, “primarily defending maritime shipping against attacks by Houthi militants in Yemen.” The Navy is currently operating [two carrier strike groups](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-navy-carrier-strike-groups-significant-combat-power-middle-east-2024-8) present in the area, each of which costs $8.7 million per day to operate. (This led to a particularly odd moment when Vice President Kamala Harris [boasted on the debate stage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/11/trump-harris-debate-us-troops-combat-zones/75171915007/) that there are no US troops present in conflict zones.)

The amount of taxpayer money sent to Israel this year was not easy to calculate, or perfectly precise. The Pentagon has not been releasing regular reports on weapons transfers and military loans to Israel. Researchers were forced to rely on news reports instead. “The patchwork government reporting on U.S. military aid to Israel contrasts sharply with the treatment of military aid to Ukraine, where dollar amounts, channels of delivery, and specific systems supplied (including how many) are routinely reported in government-supplied fact sheets on a regular basis,” Blimes, Hartung, and Semler wrote.

This year’s $17.9 billion sum is by far the most the US government has spent on Israel’s military since the country’s founding in 1948, the researchers said, adding that the spending “exceeds the historic amounts of military aid approved for Israel following the Camp David Accords in 1978 and, before that, the start of the October War of 1973.” Though this number is unusually high, Israel has throughout its history received more US military aid than any other country, benefiting from $251.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959.

“All of us have an obligation to…put the pieces of the picture together, and to look at not just the money that’s spent on war, but its toll on human lives,” Savell said.
